# Simulation based calibration

This repository contains all necessary data and code to conduct simulation based-calibration on a model described in the paper: La Rochelle, X., Higgs, T., Towards a Better Understanding of Structured Professional Judgment: Modeling Clinical Judgment in Violence Risk Estimation. 

The statistical model under study is a multi-level ordinal multiple regression model with monotonic predictors fitted using the R2D2M2 prior.
